I AM ROSE ADELE MARIA KESSLER, 
AND I HAVE SO MANY LAYERS 

MY MOM IS FRENCH
AND  MY DAD IS ENGLISH AND AMERICAN 

BUT IN REALITY, 
MY GRANDFATHER ON MY FATHERS SIDE WAS JEWISH IN AUSTRALIA DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND HAD TO FLEE THE NAZIS 
THAT’S WHERE KESSLER COMES FROM - KESSLER MEANS COPPER MERCHANT IN AUSTRIAN.
AND MY GRANDMOTHER,  BRITISH  FROM A CORSAIR LINEARE.

ON MY MOTHERS SIDE  ON THE OTHER HAND 
MY FAMILY WE’RE AVID SUPPORTERS OF PÉTIN DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR - 
PÉTIN WAS THE EXTREME RIGHT LEADER WHO COLLABORATED WITH THE NAZIS.

IRONIC MUCH ?
